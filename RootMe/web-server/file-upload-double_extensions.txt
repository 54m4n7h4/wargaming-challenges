Task on Root-me: https://www.root-me.org/en/Challenges/Web-Server/File-upload-double-extensions

Your goal is to hack this photo galery by uploading PHP code.
Retrieve the validation password in the file .passwd at the root of the application.

I'm done this task by uploading uploader.php script and in upload.php upload shell.

Download
	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RomaniukVadim/romaniukvadim.github.io/master/shell/uploader.php
and
	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RomaniukVadim/romaniukvadim.github.io/master/shell/b375k.php
Shell password: mobius

At first upload uploader.php with this link

http://challenge01.root-me.org/web-serveur/ch20/?action=upload

then go to uploaded uploader.php and upload b375k.php and read .passwd file
