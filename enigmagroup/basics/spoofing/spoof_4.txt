Pulled up console in Chrome and viewed source. 

There is a commented out section of code

function writeCookie() {
    var today = new Date();
    var the_date = new Date("December 31, 2023");
    var the_cookie_date = the_date.toGMTString();
    var the_cookie = "res="+ screen.width +"x"+ screen.height;
    var the_cookie = the_cookie + ";expires=" + the_cookie_date;
    document.cookie=the_cookie
    window.location = "index.php";
}
writeCookie();

I simply changed the screen.width and screen.height to both be 1337. The page autorefreshed and that was it.
