on line 53 of source it loads a JS file that is encoded
go to http://www.greymagic.com/security/tools/decoder/decoder.asp to decode it
you get

function login( form )
{
	// Set the username and password variables
	var username = form.user.value
	var password = form.pass.value

	// Check username and password. 
	if ( ( username == String.fromCharCode( 106,111,104,110,110,121 ) ) && ( password == String.fromCharCode( 107,101,98,97,98 ) ) )
	{
		setTimeout( "location.replace( '"+password+".php' );", 0 );
	}
	else
	{
		alert( "You are wrong." );
	}
}&#65533;

username is johnny
password is kebab

plug the above code into console but remove the form parameter and change username and password to what they're supposed to be. then just call the function
