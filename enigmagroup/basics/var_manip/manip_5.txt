it's a CSRF so we need to do something malicious when a user visits a page

at first you think it is the shout box that you directly exploit but it's actually the avatar on the profile page

if you set your avatar as http://www.enigmagroup.org/missions/basics/vm/5/index.php?page=shout&message=somejunk&submit=Post

then when a user visits the page it will do that request in the background and post something as the logged in user

O_o
