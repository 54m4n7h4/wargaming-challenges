Downloaded a gif (rainbow.gif)

Opened it in Gimp, went to Image -> Image Properties
Added <?php phpinfo(); ?> as a comment and exported the new gif as a gif. 
Change the new gif's file extension to .php
Upload but tamper it with tamper data and just like challenge 9 go into the post and change the Content-Type to images/gif
