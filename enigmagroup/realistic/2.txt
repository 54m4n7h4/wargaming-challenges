look in robots.txt and we see the admin directory

needs a null byte attack

http://www.enigmagroup.org/missions/realistics/2/index.php?page=../admin/index.php%00

this shows the source code of admin/index.php

add the cookie through console

document.cookie='admin=Brain-Tek Administrator:4fe56cc1316aa2c0291bba957df0513e'

try adding a news article and an error will pop up. at first you think SQLi but actually you just need to access the /admin/news directory

there is a rar in there. download cRARk and crack it with the rockyou wordlist

password is brain. cRARk gives it in hex O_o

purchase code is 1JH-8DQ-B6X-P1D

first you have to delete the logs, so go back to the admin page and go to the delete news area. 
there is a logs directory under admin and it has a accesslog.txt in it
so submit that and in tamper data change the directory from news to logs

then go to the send.php and submit the purchase code
