Dear Mr. Jeff Pieres, CEO:

Enclosed in this .zip file is the blueprints that you asked for.

The development of the TechnoCop is coming along great. So far it annihilates anyone that thinks about anything listed in a set "Criminal Thoughts" list.
It's mind reading range is approximately one-hundred yards. It's killing tactics are quick, clean, and silent.
It uses a method similar to your "Super Sonic Nausea," except the method used in TechonoCop is on a MUCH larger scale, causing the target's brain to collapse.

We've tested it secretly on unsuspecting civillians in a small town in Illinois. The local police were baffled when they couldn't detect any obvious signs of death.

This thing is going to be a big hit.
You could sell this for amounts of money that the general public doesn't even know exists!


We're currently working on increasing the attack range. By the end of the year, we should be completely done with TechnoCop model 0010.




Thank you,
   Gregory Millers, Chief Developer
   Technologic, Inc.
