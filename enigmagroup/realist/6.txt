notice the robots.txt
it shows you the directory cms_admin

from the root of the challenge you can access the diabolic directory
on the status page we can see there is a mysql database
on the security page we can see there is a login page for eguMyAdmin
we can access diabolic/egumyadmin.php
go into there

we can only see ua_db (all the rest say nothing to see here)
select browse on it

playing with these long ones you'll notice similarities between the two. it starts and ends with the same hash which is below

2d8336401777a1465fb168bf2743c138 f4eea83977c5ad0986465c40bb255193 2d8336401777a1465fb168bf2743c138

2d8336401777a1465fb168bf2743c138f4eea83977c5ad09 : diabolic

they each then have a unique MD5 in the middle

you can log in to the forums with these

after logging in with Mephisto notice the cookie is an MD5. it is JohnSmith hashed about 7 times
it is the same if you are logged in as Tyrael

notice a link at the bottom of the page when you are Mephisto
it takes you to index.php?page=adm1npan3l
so cms_admin is just a red herring

you inject sql via the user agent. this part is hard as balls
if you are on the right track it prints out 1
pay attention to naming conventions in egumyadmin and the form for logging in
the form gives two column names: ua_administrator and ua_password
null union all select 1--
null union all select 1 from ua_admin--
