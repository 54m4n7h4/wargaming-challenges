look at robots.txt (since the mission description mentions google dorking)

there is an unprotected admin/notes directory with a file in it
open it and see:

admins, the old password has been changed 
for the real admin login area in

 admin/real_admin_area_hidden_from_hackers_and_google

it is now, 

they_will_never_guess_this_pass

thanks,

login to admin/real_admin_area_hidden_from_hackers_and_google using
